Caltech Library Rules
=====================

This package implements a collection of rules that can be applied to
from EPrints data structure. The rules evolved from CaltechAUTHORS
and CaltechTHESIS repository practice. The rules can be applied as
a set (e.g. the `-clsrules` option in the doi2eprintxml tool) or
individually building up from an empty set of rules.
