The basic recipe
----------------

- Find the Zip file listed matching the architecture you're running
  and download it
      - (e.g. if you're on a Windows 10 laptop/Surface with a amd64
        style CPU you'd choose the Zip file with "windows-amd64" in the
        name).
- Download the zip file and unzip the file.
- Copy the contents of the folder named "bin" to a folder that is in
  your path
      - (e.g. "\$HOME/bin" is common).
- Adjust your PATH if needed
      - (e.g. `export PATH="\$HOME/bin:\$PATH"`)
- Test
