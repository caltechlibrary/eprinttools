Hello everyone,

There is a note regarding changes to how our Caltech Libary 
specific rules work when cross walking data from DataCite and CrossRef
into EPrint XMl. CaltechAUTHORS has a DOI field which we need to
populate. Historically the DOI for the article was placed in the
related URL field. This is problematic because it is difficulty to
tell if the related URL is a URL to supplemental material or 
to the article itself. I have added an option to use the 1.0.1 release
rules if you need the old behavior (see 
`doi2eprintxml -h` for list of options).


Thank you,

Robert
