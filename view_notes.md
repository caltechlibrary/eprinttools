Views in our various EPrints repositories
=========================================

Notes from Google Scholar
-------------------------

It looks likes /view/ids/ and /view/year/ maybe used by the GoogleBot as Google Scholar understands EPrints' directory layout even though those aren't usually linked from the homepage.  We also want to generate a "latest additions" link so that larger repositories can have their additions and updates picked up quicker. Google Scholar docs are at https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing.

Questions
---------

+ People, person, persion-az include the creators.item values and sometimes include contributors or editors values, should this be consistent?
+ We have lots of pays to describe an EPrints item type, should be standardize? (e.g. Type vs. Document Types)

Common views
------------

ids
: is based on the eprint id, appears to be a default view but not usually included in browseviews.html (results is a list of list of one item)

publication
: is based on publication simple field, many repositories have this, labeling of view varies but path is consistent

issn
: is base on issn simple field, many repositories have this, labeling is uppercase of field name

group
: is based on local_group.item, many repostiroes, labeling is usually Group 

person
: is based on creators, is in many repositories but not often in browseview.html, seems to be the same as people view, in some cases (Campus Pubs) it appears to include people with other affilations such as editor and contributors

person-az
: is based on creators, is in most repositories, often in browseview labed Person

collection
: is based on collection simple field, should probably be in all repositories but isn't listed often in browseview.html
